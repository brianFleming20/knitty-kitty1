This is a product selection website that will be ask customers to place an order to the company, then request
for payment will follow. At a later iteration of the site construction, a payment or several payment methods
will be included to convert the website to a e-commerse type.

The user login function is user to seperate the admin from the public enquiries and orders. 
The addresses of the orders are kept temperararly within a database, but is deleted on order completion.
Whilst the address are stored, these are encrypted for safety and security. 
Once the order is complete and has been processes, two emails are sent to the recipitent and one to the company 
to request and confirm the order.

The registration and login processes are as normal with passwords, but the user is removed from the system 
once the order is complete.
If the user is logged in and there is no activity on the site, a login manager is used to auto logout after 
a length of time which requests a re-login event.

The front page style is based on the 'F' format layout requiring the user to cast their eye along the top and 
then the centre section. Once the user is logged in, buttons are active and the product selection can continue.
